# resume
My résumé, made with an HTML5 templating engine I designed and implemented with
a friend: Emerald templating language (https://github.com/emerald-lang).

# Setup
To compile Emerald and SASS source files, follow these steps:

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/armcburney/resume`.
2. Run `bundle install` to install dev dependencies.
3. Run `ruby bin/compile` to generate compiled HTML from Emerald source.
